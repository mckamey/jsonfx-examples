CalendarApp.WikiDump

This is a quick and dirty console app which reads historical dates from Wikipedia
for each day of the year and then inserts them into the CalendarApp via JSON-RPC.

Note it is not super robust or performant, it is mostly just useful for populating
some real data into the database.
