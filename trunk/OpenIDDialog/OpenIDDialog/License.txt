This project takes inspration from the OpenID plug-in for jQuery:

	OpenID Plugin <http://code.google.com/p/openid-realselector/>

In addition to providing a clean UI for OpenID authentication, this project
demonstrates how JBSTs can be built as library components to be shared
across projects.

Maintaining chunks of UI as JBSTs have the convenience of jQuery plug-ins while
providing a more familiar and easier to maintain design surface to work within.
